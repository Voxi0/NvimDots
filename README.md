# NvimDots
This is my personal configuration for Neovim using the <a href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim">lazy.nvim</a> plugin manager.

I took some things from <a href="https://nvchad.com/">NVChad</a> and <a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/">LazyVim</a>.
Thanks to these amazing distributions, I discovered some cool new plugins like <a href="https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp">blink.cmp</a>
for autocompletion which is far easier and performant compared to <a href="https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp">nvim-cmp</a>
and useful keybinds that just makes life easier.
