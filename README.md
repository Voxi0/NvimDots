# NvimDots
This is my personal configuration for Neovim using the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager. I took some things from
<a href="https://nvchad.com/">NVChad</a> and <a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/">LazyVim</a>.
Thanks to these amazing distributions, I discovered some cool new plugins like `blink.cmp` and useful keybinds that just makes life easier.
