This is my personal configuration for Neovim using the <a href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim">lazy.nvim</a> plugin manager.

I took some things from [NVChad](https://nvchad.com/) and [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/). Thanks to these amazing distributions, I discovered some cool
new plugins like <a href="https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp">blink.cmp</a> for autocompletion which is far easier and performant compared to
[nvim.cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) and useful keybinds that just makes life easier e.g. pressing `Control + S` keys saves the file which many
people are used to because this keybind is used in literally every text editing software out there like Notepad and Word.
